        <br><h2>The Buddha</h2><p> <br> Siddhartha Gautama,[e] most commonly referred to as the Buddha (lit. 'the awakened one'),[4][f][g] was a wandering ascetic and religious teacher who lived in South Asia[h] during the 6th or 5th century BCE[5][6][7][c] and founded Buddhism. According to Buddhist legends, he was born in Lumbini, in what is now Nepal,[b] to royal parents of the Shakya clan, but renounced his home life to live as a wandering ascetic.[8][i] After leading a life of mendicancy, asceticism, and meditation, he attained nirvana at Bodh Gaya in what is now India. The Buddha then wandered through the lower Indo-Gangetic Plain, teaching and building a monastic order. Buddhist tradition holds he died in Kushinagar and reached parinirvana ("final release from conditioned existence").[9][j]

        According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha taught a Middle Way between sensual indulgence and severe asceticism,[10] leading to freedom from ignorance, craving, rebirth, and suffering. His core teachings are summarized in the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, a training of the mind that includes ethical training and kindness toward others, and meditative practices such as sense restraint, mindfulness, dhyana (meditation proper). Another key element of his teachings are the concepts of the five skandhas and dependent origination, describing how all dharmas (both mental states and concrete 'things') come into being, and cease to be, depending on other dharmas, lacking an existence on their own svabhava.
        
        While in the Nikayas he frequently refers to himself as the Tathāgata, the earliest attestation of the title Buddha is from the 3rd century BCE,[11][12] meaning 'Awakened One' or 'Enlightened One'.[13] His teachings were compiled by the Buddhist community in the Vinaya, his codes for monastic practice, and the Sutta Piṭaka, a compilation of teachings based on his discourses. These were passed down in Middle Indo-Aryan dialects through an oral tradition.[14][15] Later generations composed additional texts, such as systematic treatises known as Abhidharma, biographies of the Buddha, collections of stories about his past lives known as Jataka tales, and additional discourses, i.e., the Mahayana sutras.[16][17]
        
        Buddhism evolved into a variety of traditions and practices, represented by Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana, and spread beyond the Indian subcontinent. While Buddhism declined in India, and mostly disappeared after the 8th century CE due to a lack of popular and economic support, Buddhism is more prominent in Southeast and East Asia.Etymology, names and titles

        The Buddha, Tapa Shotor monastery in Hadda, Afghanistan, 2nd century CE
        Siddhārtha Gautama and Buddha Shakyamuni
        According to Donald Lopez Jr., "... he tended to be known as either Buddha or Sakyamuni in China, Korea, Japan, and Tibet, and as either Gotama Buddha or Samana Gotama ('the ascetic Gotama') in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia."[18]
        
        Buddha, "Awakened One" or "Enlightened One",[13][19][f] is the masculine form of budh (बुध् ), "to wake, be awake, observe, heed, attend, learn, become aware of, to know, be conscious again",[20] "to awaken"[21][22] "'to open up' (as does a flower)",[22] "one who has awakened from the deep sleep of ignorance and opened his consciousness to encompass all objects of knowledge".[22] It is not a personal name, but a title for those who have attained bodhi (awakening, enlightenment).[21] Buddhi, the power to "form and retain concepts, reason, discern, judge, comprehend, understand",[20] is the faculty which discerns truth (satya) from falsehood.
        
        The name of his clan was Gautama (Pali: Gotama). His given name, "Siddhārtha" (the Sanskrit form; the Pali rendering is "Siddhattha"; in Tibetan it is "Don grub"; in Chinese "Xidaduo"; in Japanese "Shiddatta/Shittatta"; in Korean "Siltalta") means "He Who Achieves His Goal".[23] The clan name of Gautama means "descendant of Gotama", "Gotama" meaning "one who has the most light",[24] and comes from the fact that Kshatriya clans adopted the names of their house priests.[25][26]
        
        While the term Buddha is used in the Agamas and the Pali Canon, the oldest surviving written records of the term Buddha is from the middle of the 3rd century BCE, when several Edicts of Ashoka (reigned c. 269–232 BCE) mention the Buddha and Buddhism.[11][12] Ashoka's Lumbini pillar inscription commemorates the Emperor's pilgrimage to Lumbini as the Buddha's birthplace, calling him the Buddha Shakyamuni[k] (Brahmi script: 𑀩𑀼𑀥 𑀲𑀓𑁆𑀬𑀫𑀼𑀦𑀻 Bu-dha Sa-kya-mu-nī, "Buddha, Sage of the Shakyas").[27]
        
        Śākyamuni, Sakyamuni, or Shakyamuni (Sanskrit: शाक्यमुनि, [ɕaːkjɐmʊnɪ]) means "Sage of the Shakyas".[28]
        
        Tathāgata
        Tathāgata (Pali; Pali: [tɐˈtʰaːɡɐtɐ]) is a term the Buddha commonly used when referring to himself or other Buddhas in the Pāli Canon.[29] The exact meaning of the term is unknown, but it is often thought to mean either "one who has thus gone" (tathā-gata), "one who has thus come" (tathā-āgata), or sometimes "one who has thus not gone" (tathā-agata). This is interpreted as signifying that the Tathāgata is beyond all coming and going—beyond all transitory phenomena.[30] A tathāgata is "immeasurable", "inscrutable", "hard to fathom", and "not apprehended".[31]
        
        Other epithets
        A list of other epithets is commonly seen together in canonical texts and depicts some of his perfected qualities:[32]
        
        Bhagavato (Bhagavan) – The Blessed one, one of the most used epithets, together with tathāgata[29]
        Sammasambuddho – Perfectly self-awakened
        Vijja-carana-sampano – Endowed with higher knowledge and ideal conduct.
        Sugata – Well-gone or well-spoken.
        Lokavidu – Knower of the many worlds.
        Anuttaro Purisa-damma-sarathi – Unexcelled trainer of untrained people.
        Satthadeva-Manussanam – Teacher of gods and humans.
        Araham – Worthy of homage. An Arahant is "one with taints destroyed, who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and is completely liberated through final knowledge".
        Jina – Conqueror. Although the term is more commonly used to name an individual who has attained liberation in the religion Jainism, it is also an alternative title for the Buddha.[33]
